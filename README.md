# 👋 Welcome 

Hello / Hola / 안녕하세요!

I'm David Valencia, a Robotics and Machine Learning Engineer. Welcome to my coding space! Here, you’ll find the projects I’m currently working on and the ones I’m most proud of. Most of what you see here is self-taught, and I’m always happy to share what I’ve learned.

## About me:

- I specialise in Robotics, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning, with a strong focus on turning complex research into real-world applications.

- I have a few academic publications and love bridging the gap between theory and practical innovation.

- Currently based in Auckland, New Zealand.

- Always curious, always building.
